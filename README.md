#To-do

### Minor
- Make code neater / rename functions.
 
- Timing analysis: plot a graph of number of row & columns against time taken to solve puzzle.

- Analyse the problem of 'squizzed' view when grid order is high (â‰¥ 10 rows & columns).

- How to visualise palindromes and repeated words.

### Major
- Try 3-dimensional solving (3D graph) and visualise, distinctly, "streams," or lines connecting letters that form words. In 3D, the four-colour visualisation system will no longer work.

- Try solving actual cross-word puzzles.

- Try to device a learning mechanism which can be used to make solving future puzzles easier.
